🗓️ Monthly Work Log – November 2025
🔹 1. Summary of What I Worked On

This month, I focused on deepening my backend engineering skills through a series of structured ALX projects.
My main areas of work included:

Designing and normalizing SQL database schemas for an Airbnb clone project.

Implementing complex SQL operations: joins, subqueries, aggregations, indexing, and partitioning.

Developing Python scripts using generators for efficient data streaming and batch processing.

Building decorators for logging, connection management, transactions, retries, and caching.

Exploring context managers and asynchronous programming for database operations using aiosqlite and asyncio.

🏆 2. Achievements

Completed Airbnb database system design from ERD to optimized SQL implementation.

Successfully wrote advanced SQL queries with performance monitoring and optimization.

Built robust Python decorators that simplified database logic and error handling.

Created custom context managers for database operations (both sync and async).

Implemented asynchronous concurrent database queries using asyncio.gather() — a first for me!

Improved my understanding of clean code organization and modular architecture in backend projects.

💡 3. Learnings from Challenges

Database performance tuning was more complex than expected — learning to interpret EXPLAIN ANALYZE helped me understand real-world query costs.

Writing async code required unlearning some synchronous habits. It took patience to structure event loops correctly and avoid blocking calls.

I learned that decorator stacking order in Python matters — for example, when combining transaction and retry logic.

I improved my debugging process by adopting logging over print statements, which made error tracking cleaner and more scalable.

🌟 4. Monthly Highlights

Built my first end-to-end backend system using Python + MySQL.

Gained confidence using context managers to manage database state safely.

Learned how to design with scalability in mind — from query efficiency to modular code.

Started documenting my work in GitHub repos following ALX professional standards.

Overall, I saw real progress in writing cleaner, more maintainable backend code.

✍️ Next Steps

Explore Celery and RabbitMQ for asynchronous task queues.

Deploy a small FastAPI project integrating async database operations.

Continue optimizing SQL schemas with real-world data simulation.

Strengthen API documentation using Swagger and drf-yasg.
